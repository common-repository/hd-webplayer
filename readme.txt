* RTMP stands for "Real Time Messaging Protocol". It is a proprietary protocol developed by Adobe Systems for streaming audio, video and data over the Internet, between a Flash player and a server. All the major RTMP servers such as Red5, Wowza and Adobe Flash Media Server are supported by HD Webplayer.
* Pseudo Streaming is a protocol that can be installed on regular HTTP servers such as Apache, Tomcat, IIS or lighthttpd. It uses a server-side script for Flash-to-Server communication that is supported by HD Webplayer.
* A Content Delivery Network (CDN) offers several advantages over a plain webserver for streaming video. For example, a CDN will be able to speedily deliver your videos across the country and globe, it will be able to stream your videos instead of a download and it will be able to scale to large numbers of videos and viewers. The Amazon CloudFront CDN is particularly interesting, since everybody can instantly and easily sign up for it. On top of that, Amazon only charges for usage (in terms of GB of video stored and streamed), so there's no fixed costs. HD Webplayer supports playback for the streams from Amazon Storage.
* The HD Webplayer supports Live HTTP DVR streaming as offered by the Bitgravity CDN.
* If you are using a commercial version with the KEY provided by HD Webplayer Sales Team, you will have option to remove HD Webplayer FREE text and you will be having your own Domain Name in the Context Menu that comes from the Right Click on the Player.
